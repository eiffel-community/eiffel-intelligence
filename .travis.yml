# since we run parallel tests using embedded mongodb in fresh environment all tests run first in parallel
# will try to download the embedded mongo to this travis instance but the late ones will fail to write.
# We will therefore run one test using mongodb first that will download the mongo instance and
# then the rest of the test that will no longer need to download the embedded mongo since it will exist.
#
# It is also important that the first test to be run is a Spring Boot Test since spring boot also downloads
# another version of embedded mongo db so all Spring Boot tests will end up in a race condition also
