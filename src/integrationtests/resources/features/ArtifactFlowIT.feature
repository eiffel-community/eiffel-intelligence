Feature: Artifact flow Integrationtest
   Scenario: Send eiffel events for artifact flow and make sure EI is triggering on mail subscriptions
    Given that "mail" subscription with jmespath "id=='aacc3c87-75e0-4b6d-88f5-b1a5d4e62b43'" is uploaded
    And the rules "src/test/resources/ArtifactRules_new.json"
    And the events "src/test/resources/ArtifactFlowTestEvents.json"
    And the resulting aggregated object "src/test/resources/AggregatedDocumentInternalCompositionLatestIT.json";
    And the expected aggregated object ID is "aacc3c87-75e0-4b6d-88f5-b1a5d4e62b43"
    And the upstream input "src/test/resources/upStreamInput.json"
    When the upstream input events are sent
    And the eiffel events are sent
