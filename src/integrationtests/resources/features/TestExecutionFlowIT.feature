Feature: Test execution flow integrationtest
  Scenario: Send eiffel events for test execution flow and make sure EI is triggering on REST-POST subscriptions
    Given the rules "src/test/resources/TestExecutionObjectRules.json"
    And the events "src/test/resources/TestExecutionTestEvents.json"
    And the resulting aggregated object "src/test/resources/aggregatedTestActivityObject.json";
    And the expected aggregated object ID is "e46ef12d-25gb-4d7y-b9fd-8763re66de47"
    And jenkins is set up with a job "test-execution-job"
    And that "REST/POST" subscription with jmespath "activity_triggered_event_id=='e46ef12d-25gb-4d7y-b9fd-8763re66de47'" is uploaded
    When the eiffel events are sent
    Then the jenkins job should have been triggered.
