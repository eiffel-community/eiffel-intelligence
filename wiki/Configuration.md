# Configuration

Address and port for message buss and MongoDB needs to be configured in [application.properties](https://github.com/Ericsson/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties) for the application to run properly.

Each property is explained in the file so open the properties file for a view on properties role.
