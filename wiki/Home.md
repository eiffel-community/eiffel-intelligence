## _Introduction_

Eiffel Intelligence is a service that aggregates information from different events of a flow with the purpose of notifying subscribers when content of interest has been collected from desired flow events. The aggregation is stored in a JSON object. By flow we mean a chain of Eiffel events that are linked together directly or indirectly. 

Eiffel Intelligence uses a set of rules to define what information will be extracted from an Eiffel event in the flow and at what location to store this information in the aggregated object. Today only one rule set can be run in each instance and the reason is that in an Eiffel domain with millions of events flowing we will have multiple extractions and checks for each rule set and multiple rule sets in same service will require large machines and more difficult optimization.

Eiffel intelligence uses subscriptions to notify interested parties when several evens have occurred with desired content in an aggregated object. Every time an aggregated object is updated we check whether any subscription is fulfilled by the current state of the aggregated object. 

## Aggregated object

Term "Aggregated object" in Eiffel Intelligence vocabulary means composition of several Eiffel events into one big JSON object using a special rule mechanism. The main purpose for aggregated object is to create customizable JSON document which could be used later used for visualization and better tracing using different visual engines (VE). Inside the rule mechanism the JMESPath is used for selecting the needed data from Eiffel event and inserting it.
