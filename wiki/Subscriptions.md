# Subscriptions

When the desired Eiffel events have been aggregated a user would like to be notified and there is possibility to register a subscription that will be run on each save of an aggregated object in the database.

We support today notifications by email or by doing rest post.

It is possible for users to add comments, at any level, in subscriptions. These comments should be a new field in the given subscription, e.g., "description": "It is my comment"
