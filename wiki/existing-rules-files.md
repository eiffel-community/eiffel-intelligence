# Existing rules

We have created some rules that represent some use cases triggering the 
development of the Eiffel Intelligence. The files containing the rules 
can be found [**here.**](../src/main/resources/rules)

We have also drawn the flows that the existing rules need to perform the 
aggregation. The drawings contain the events and how they are linked together.
