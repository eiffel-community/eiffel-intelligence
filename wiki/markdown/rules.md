## What is JMESPath?

JMESPath is a query language for JSON. You can extract and transform elements
from a JSON document. The result of applying a JMESPath expression against a
JSON document will always result in valid JSON, provided there are no errors
during the evaluation process. This also means that, with the exception of
JMESPath expression types, JMESPath only supports the same types support by
JSON:

    number (integers and double-precision floating-point format in JSON)
    string
    boolean (true or false)
    array (an ordered, sequence of values)
    object (an unordered collection of key value pairs)
    null

Let's go to an example of simple query called identifier. An identifier is the
most basic expression and can be used to extract a single element from a JSON
object. The return value for an identifier is the value associated with the
identifier. If the identifier does not exist in the JSON document, than a null
value is returned. Assume that we have such JSON object
{"a": {"b": {"c": {"d": "value"}}}} and we need to get the string "value" from
object. The JMESPath identifier will be a.b.c.d. [JMESPath identifier documentation](http://jmespath.org/specification.html#identifiers).

### Extract data from Eiffel event

        {
            "meta": {
                "id": "e3be0cf8-2ebd-4d6d-bf5c-a3b535cd084e",
                "type": "EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent",
                "version": "1.1.0",
                "time": 1521452400324,
                "tags": [],
                "source": {
                    "serializer": "pkg:maven/com.mycompany.tools/eiffel-serializer@1.0.3",
                    "uri": "http://host:port/path"
                }
            },
            "data": {
                "name": "dummy_1_stable",
                "value": "SUCCESS"
            },
            "links": [
                {
                    "type": "SUBJECT",
                    "target": "df4cdb42-1580-4cff-b97a-4d0faa9b2b22"
                }
            ]
        }

Lets go through an example, in which we need to extract the value "SUCCESS"
from an Eiffel event. The expression for such a JSON query will be
"data.value".

Eiffel Intelligence uses JMESPath for extracting information from events and
for post processing of data in an aggregated object. Hence, JMESPath is used
to traverse JSON structures when writing rules, subscription requirements or
querying an aggregated object.

## Rule set up

Rules for object aggregation consist of JSON object with a defined structure
inside it. Key in this object is rule specification and value is JMESPath
identifier. Separate rule set is created for each event type that is going to
take participation in creating of aggregated object. This means that if you
want to create your aggregated object from 3 event types and all other event
types to discard, you will need 3 set of rules. Each rule might contain some of
these keys, that have not null or empty values. Explicit list of rule keys are
below:

### TemplateName 
This field is used for specifying a group for your set of rules. It can be 
any string you like to name your rule set.

### Type 
This field indicates the Eiffel event type. It will be used to find the 
matching rule set for the received Eiffel event while creating the aggregated 
object. Example: `"Type": "EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent"`

### TypeRule 
JMESPath identifier for the location of where to find the Eiffel event type 
in a received Eiffel event. Example: "meta.type". 
[Example Eiffel events can be found here](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/tree/master/examples/events).

### IdRule 
JMESPath identifier to find the location of the Eiffel event id in a
received Eiffel event. Example: `meta.id`. Used as fall back when storing in
database and no id is provided or to link id's of aggregated objects to events
that contributed to the aggregated object.

### StartEvent
This field denotes if this event type starts the object aggregation. If
StartEvent is "YES" then it will be the first processed event in the aggregation
sequence. If StartEvent is "NO" then Eiffel events of this type will be used to
append information to existing aggregated object. If no aggregated object exist
then it will wait a certain time as defined by property
_waitlist.collection.ttlValue_ in [application's properties](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties)
until wanted aggregated object has been created. If no aggregated object is
created in time then the event will no longer be processed and it will be
removed from the wait list.

### IdentifyRules
JMESPath identifier of ids that will be used to search in the database 
for an existing aggregated object. This describes how Eiffel events of 
a certain type should link to an existing aggregation. If using a JMESPath 
expression it should produce a JSON array with an Eiffel event id.

`"IdentifyRules" : [meta.id]` will return the specified field in an array, like this:

    ["sb6e51h0-25ch-4dh7-b9sd-876g8e6kde47"].

Another common example is:

    "links | [?type=='CAUSE'].target"

which will extract the Eiffel event id from the links array value of 
target, where "type" is equal "CAUSE". Links in an Eiffel event look like this:

    {
       "links":[
          {
             "target":"f37d59a3-069e-4f4c-8cc5-a52e73501a75",
             "type":"CAUSE"
          },
         {
             "target":"cfce572b-c3j4-441e-abc9-b62f48080ca2",
             "type":"ELEMENT"
         }
      ]
    }

Applying the above links extraction rule will give ["f37d59a3-069e-4f4c-8cc5-a52e73501a75"]

If ids of all links is needed then this:

    links | [].target

will return

    [
     "f37d59a3-069e-4f4c-8cc5-a52e73501a75",
     "cfce572b-c3j4-441e-abc9-b62f48080ca2"
    ]

### MatchIdRules 
This rule is used to define a search condition when Eiffel Intelligence 
searches the the database for matching aggregated objects. The **syntax 
of this rule is specific to querying in Mongo DB** and JMESPath syntax 
should not be used here. 

### ExtractionRules
JSON object of JMESPath identifier(s) which will create
or modify the existing data in aggregated object. For a start event the content
extracted with this rule will be the initial aggregated object.

For example

    "{confidenceLevels :[{ eventId:meta.id, time:meta.time, name:data.name, value:data.value}]}"

will create JSON object "confidenceLevels" and the value of it will be array
with 1 JSON element. This one key in this JSON object will be "eventId" and its
value will be the result of searching for "meta.id" identifier in the received
Eiffel event, for example "cfce572b-c3j4-441e-abc9-b62f48080ca2" and so on.

Evaluation of specified extraction rules on the received Eiffel event may be
the JSON object

    {
      "confidenceLevels":[
        {
         "eventId":"f37d59a3-069e-4f4c-8cc5-a52e73501a75",
         "name":"readyForDelivery",
         "time":1481875944272,
         "value":"SUCCESS"
        }
     ]
    }

which could be added to the root of aggregated object or to the inner structure
of aggregated object depending on **_MergeResolverRules_**.

### MergeResolverRules
This is a JSON object describing the entire path or
parts of the path to where the extracted content will be stored. More detailed
explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/wiki/markdown/merge-resolver-rules.md)

### ProcessRules 
This rule is used to append new key value pairs in the aggregated object 
based on existing values in the aggregation object. Eiffel Intelligence will 
only perform additions or modifications or existing content in the aggregation, 
no delete operations will be performed. For example if you have aggregated 
the job finished time and job started time then you can create one more value 
for the computed duration so that other systems do not need to compute it.

### History Rules 
If your start event, meaning the event that starts the chain of aggregation, 
contains links that point to upstream events, HistoryRules makes it 
possible for these to be aggregated into the object as well. They are 
explained [**here**](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/wiki/markdown/history-rules.md)

## Using placeholders in rules
When you want to write a condition including an unknown Eiffel event id, 
it is possible to use a placeholder to let Eiffel Intelligence inject the 
Eiffel event ids extracted from **_IdentifyRules_**. The use of this placeholder
value can only be used for **MatchIdRules** and **ProcessRules**. 
 
The placeholder is defined as a property called [**rules.replacement.marker**](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/wiki/markdown/configuration.md#define-placeholder-in-rules) 
in [application.properties](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties).

If we configure the 'rules.replacement.marker' in application.properties:

    rules.replacement.marker: %myPlaceholderId%

And we define the below MatchIdRules for our Eiffel event:

    {"_id": "%myPlaceholderId%"},
    { "$and": [{"testCaseExecutions.testCaseStartedEventId": "%myPlaceholderId%"}]}

Eiffel Intelligence will replace the placeholder with the extracted value 
from the IdentifyRules. If we take the previously mentioned example: 

    "IdentifyRules": "links | [?type=='CAUSE'].target"

Eiffel Intelligence will analyze the JMESPath expression of the IdentifyRules.
This will result in an Eiffel event id as a value. This extracted Eiffel 
event id will then be used to replace the 'rules.replacement.marker' in MatchIdRules:

    {"_id": "f37d59a3-069e-4f4c-8cc5-a52e73501a75"},
    { "$and": [{"testCaseExecutions.testCaseStartedEventId": "f37d59a3-069e-4f4c-8cc5-a52e73501a75"}]}

Using the 'rules.replacement.marker' placeholder in the rules, helps the 
user who wants to use an event id of a future Eiffel event (currently 
unknown) in conditions they include in their rules. Some examples of it's 
usage can be found in [the template rules](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/tree/master/src/main/resources/rules).
 
## Reserved Key names
The keys "_id" and "time" (at the root level of the aggregated object) are 
reserved and added in the MongoDB document by Eiffel Intelligence. User 
should not use these two keys at the root level of an aggregated object. 
Even if the user adds these two keys at the root level, Eiffel Intelligence 
will overwrite those.
