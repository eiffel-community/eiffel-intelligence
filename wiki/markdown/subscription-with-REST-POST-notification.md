# Subscription with REST POST notification

A valid subscription for REST POST notification is provided below with comments
for each field.

_**OBS! Comments are only for documentation purposes and a subscription should
not contain them. The subscription will be rejected at this moment if it
contains comments like below.**_

_**Subscription templates can be found [here](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/tree/master/src/main/resources/templates).**_
