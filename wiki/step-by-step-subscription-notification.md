# Step By Step Subscription Notification

Suppose a subscription is created (as shown below) by a user and then that is
stored in the subscription database. Read more about the [subscription REST API](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/wiki/markdown/subscription-API.md)
and [adding subscriptions via Eiffel Intelligence frontend GUI](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence-frontend/blob/master/wiki/markdown/add-subscription.md).

                ],
            },
            {
                "conditions": [{
                        "jmespath": "identity=='pkg:maven/com.mycompany.myproduct/sub-system@1.1.0'"
                    },
                    {
                        "jmespath": "testCaseExecutions[?testCaseStartedEventId == '13af4a14-f951-4346-a1ba-624c79f10e98']"
                    }
                ],
            }
        ],
        "subscriptionName": "Subscription_Test",
        "userName": "ABC"
    }

In this subscription, two requirements are given, where each requirement in turn
contains two conditions. As per subscription logic, when all the conditions in
any one of the given requirements are met in an aggregated object then the
subscription is fulfilled. This means that the subscriber will be notified
with the chosen notification method. It should be noted that conditions are given
as JMESPath expression. Let us suppose that an aggregated object, as shown below,
is created:

    {
        "fileInformation": [{
            "extension": "jar",
            "classifier": ""
        }],
        "buildCommand": null,
        "testCaseExecutions": [{
            "testCaseFinishEventId": "11109351-41e0-474a-bc1c-f6e81e58a1c9",
            "testCaseStartedTime": 1481875925916,
            "testCaseStartedEventId": "cb9d64b0-a6e9-4419-8b5d-a650c27c59ca",
            "testCaseFinishedTime": 1481875935919,
            "testCase": {
                "conclusion": "SUCCESSFUL",
                "verdict": "PASSED",
                "tracker": "My Other Test Management System",
                "id": "TC5",
                "uri": "https://other-tm.company.com/testCase/TC5"
            }
        }],
        "id": "6acc3c87-75e0-4b6d-88f5-b1a5d4e62b43",
        "time": 1481875891763,
        "type": "ARTIFACT_1",
        "identity": "pkg:maven/com.mycompany.myproduct/sub-system@1.1.0"
    }

When this aggregated object is evaluated against the subscriptions stored in
the database, then it fulfills our subscription criteria. It can be seen 
that both conditions of the first requirement are satisfied by this aggregated 
object. More specifically, in the first condition, JMESPath rule is looking for:

    identity=='pkg:maven/com.mycompany.myproduct/sub-system@1.1.0'

and in the second condition it looks for

    testCaseExecutions.testCase.conclusion == 'SUCCESSFUL' && testCase.id=='TC5'

Both strings can be found in the aggregated object JSON. Consequently, the process
is started to send notification to the specified subscriber. For this, 
'notificationMeta' and 'notificationType' field values are extracted from 
the subscription.

## Notify via REST POST
In the example subscription above, the notification is sent as **REST POST** 
to the url `http://127.0.0.1:3000/ei/test_subscription_rest`. The notification 
message in this subscription is prepared as key value pairs in the request body.

    "notificationMessageKeyValues": [{
        "formkey": "data",
        "formvalue": "{parameters: [{ name: 'jsonparams', value : to_string(@) }, { name: 'artifact_identity', value : @.identity }]}"
    }]

The key is 'jsonparams' and the value is the full aggregated object. The 
second parameter is the artifact identity which is extracted from the 
aggregation, These are part of the notification message for this particular 
subscription. Below is a list of the parameters defined in the above notification 
message which will be sent for this subscription.

    parameters:
        jsonparams: {full aggregated object}
        artifact_identity: pkg:maven/com.mycompany.myproduct/sub-system@1.1.0

If it was sent as raw JSON body, the first parameter of the notification 
message would look like below:

    {
        [
            {
                "fileInformation": [{
                    "extension": "jar",
                    "classifier": ""
                }],
                "buildCommand": null,
                "testCaseExecutions": [{
                    "testCaseFinishEventId": "11109351-41e0-474a-bc1c-f6e81e58a1c9",
                    "testCaseStartedTime": 1481875925916,
                    "testCaseStartedEventId": "cb9d64b0-a6e9-4419-8b5d-a650c27c59ca",
                    "testCaseFinishedTime": 1481875935919,
                    "testCase": {
                        "conclusion": "SUCCESSFUL",
                        "verdict": "PASSED",
                        "tracker": "My Other Test Management System",
                        "id": "TC5",
                        "uri": "https://other-tm.company.com/testCase/TC5"
                    }
                }],
                "id": "6acc3c87-75e0-4b6d-88f5-b1a5d4e62b43",
                "time": 1481875891763,
                "type": "ARTIFACT_1",
                "identity": "pkg:maven/com.mycompany.myproduct/sub-system@1.1.0"
            }
        ]
    }


## Notify via MAIL
If the “notificationType” of the subscription is “MAIL” then the notification
message is sent to the email address(es) specified in the “notificationMeta”
field. If more than one email address is written, it should be written as a
comma separated string. The subject for the email can be set globally (same
for all subscriptions) in application.properties as "email.subject". It can
also be set for individual subscriptions using the Eiffel Intelligence front-end GUI.

As with the conditions, it is also possible to write JMESPath expressions
for the notification message. If we use the example subscription above, the
notification could be to send data extracted from the aggregated object. 
We could for example use the below JMESPath expression in the subscription 
notification message:

    "{parameters: [{ name: 'artifactIdentity', value : to_string(@.identity) }, { name: 'testCase', value: to_string(@.testCaseExecutions[0].testCase.id) }]}"

This expression selects the field identity from the aggregated object
and this is used as value for the parameter "artifactIdentity". The second 
parameter is also extracted from the aggregation and results in a string 
value of the testcase id. The complete notification message can be seen below:

    parameters:
        artifactIdentity: pkg:maven/com.mycompany.myproduct/sub-system@1.1.0
        testCase: TC5

## Failed notifications

If the notification via REST POST fails, then a fixed number of attempts are
made to resend successfully. The number of attempts are specified in the
[application.properties](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-intelligence/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties)
as “notification.failAttempt”. If message sending attempts fails for the
specified number of time, then a failed notification is prepared and stored in 
the database. The name of the collection is specified in the application.properties
file as “failed.notification.collection-name”. The message is stored in the 
database for a certain duration before being deleted. This time can be 
configured in application.properties as “notification.ttl.value”.

**Failed notification in the failed notification database with TTL value:**

    [
        {
            "subscriptionName": "Sub1",
            "aggregatedObject": { full aggregation at the time of notification attempt },
            "notificationMeta": "http://localhost:9999/some-endpoint",
            "_id": {
                "$oid": "5d807a1d821b960af311fab3"
            },
            "time": {
                "$date": "2020-10-17T06:15:57.000Z"
            },
            "message": "Failed to send REST/POST notification!\nMessage: I/O error on POST request for \"http://localhost:9999/some-endpoint\": Connect to localhost:9999 [localhost/127.0.0.1] failed: Connection refused (Connection refused); nested exception is org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connect to localhost:9999 [localhost/127.0.0.1] failed: Connection refused (Connection refused)"
        }
    ]
